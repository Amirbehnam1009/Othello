## What is Othello
Othello (Reversi) is a strategic board game played by two players who take turns placing their colored discs on a grid. The objective is to have the majority of discs of your color at the end of the game. Players capture their opponent's discs by sandwiching them between their own discs, flipping them to their own color. The game requires tactical thinking and anticipation of your opponent's moves, making it both simple to learn and deeply strategic to master.





## How To Win

Two players compete, using 64 identical game pieces ("disks") that are light on one side and dark on the other. Each player chooses one color to use throughout the game. Players take turns placing one disk on an empty square, with their assigned color facing up. After a play is made, any disks of the opponent's color that lie in a straight line bounded by the one just played and another one in the current player's color are turned over. When all playable empty squares are filled, the player with more disks showing in their own color wins the game.
